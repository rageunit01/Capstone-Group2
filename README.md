Project Purpose 
Element 1: User interface (Front end) - Website (Built in HTML and CSS).

Element 2: Database - This database has to be connected to your application/website and can be developed in SQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.. (No Access Database).

Element 3: Programming Language (Back End) - The program must use either C or Java to run in the back end.

Element 4: The application must be deployed on a server located in the cloud, personal computer, or other web service.  

Element 5: Use a repository to store all code.  An example of a repository is Git Hub.  

Element 6: Use a project management tool to track all assigned tasks and to track the progress of the application.


Project Requirements

Your group will build a full stack project that will demonstrate the skills learned in the program.  Keep in mind that to assess these skills, we created a project to meet the needs of the outcomes.  While you are always welcome to add pieces to your project, you are not allowed to remove any items required from the project. 

The application we are building is an online shopping website.  The online shopping website will have the ability to shop for clothing (shirts, pants, sweaters, shorts).  It should have two categories (men, women).  It should have the following sizes for both categories (small, medium, large, xtra large).  The website should have a log-in screen (login and signup).  You should have a screen for the shopping cart.  Once the order is placed, you should have a confirmation page.  

All data from the website once the order is placed should be stored in the database.  The database will store the customer login information, order history, and inventory for the website.  It will connect to the website and the Java or C application.

The Java or C application will be able to retrieve information from the database.  It will have a menu to produce print all the customers and their login information, Order history for each user (personalized by each user. Do not print all users and order history at once).

As mentioned, all code should be stored on a repository.  The application needs to be deployed on a server (cloud or local machine).  The Java or C application must be deployed for me to run (Executable file.  I will not open an IDE to run it).
